To do some things, you need to be sounded by some great people, after a long time, got a chance to use the iPhone to capture some great photos (BTW I am not new to the iPhone 5). This time I am using the iPhone 5. I am seeing lots of enhancement in the phone's camera and it works pretty faster than earlier version of iPhones. If you are not an iPhone user, you should give it a shot (at least go to an Apple Store to experience it ;) ) have a look and leave your comments and share your love in Facebook, twitter and wherever it's possible to share. Additionally you can view [my prvious iPhone photography](http://yoosuf.me/blog/yoosuf-iphone-photography) post.
