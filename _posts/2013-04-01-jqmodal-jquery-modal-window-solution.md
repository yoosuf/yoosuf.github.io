[jqModal](https://github.com/eyoosuf/jqModal) is one of the simple and light weighted jquery plug-in to create modal windows in your web browser without a hassle, recently when i was using jqModel with the latest version of the jQuery,  I found an issue saying <code>undefined error</code> and realized jQuery library has been updated with many refractions and many feature drops for Microsoft Internet Explore's older versions. hence I decided to change the code and republish it in my [github](https://github.com/yoosuf) for the public use. Fork it, try it out and send pull requests, I will happily update the repository.
