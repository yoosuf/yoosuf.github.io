Hi, I'm Yoosuf Mohamed, a full-stack developer based in Colombo, Sri Lanka, with over a decade of experience working for small and large companies worldwide. I'm passionate about web standards, semantics, and accessibility, and I take pride in writing clean, efficient, and effective code.

My expertise includes working with the AWS stack, ElasticSearch, Redis, and Microservices. As a full-stack software engineer, I have a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, which allows me to build robust, scalable, and secure web applications.

In front-end development, I use React and other modern JavaScript frameworks to create unique user experiences and bring designs to life. For back-end development, I use Node.js, Laravel, and other popular frameworks to build RESTful APIs and microservices.

Additionally, I have experience working with GraphQL, a query language for APIs that enables efficient data fetching and helps to reduce over-fetching and under-fetching of data. With GraphQL, I can create flexible and scalable APIs that can be used across multiple platforms and devices. I have used GraphQL with Node.js and React, as well as other front-end and back-end frameworks. My knowledge of GraphQL helps me to build optimized and performant web applications for my clients.

With ElasticSearch, I can develop powerful search functionality for web applications, while Redis provides an efficient caching solution to improve application performance. I also leverage the AWS stack to deploy and scale web applications in the cloud.

Whether it's building a simple website or a complex web application, I enjoy the challenge of delivering high-quality products that meet the needs of my clients and users. I am always eager to learn and keep up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in the industry, ensuring that my skills remain relevant and in-demand.
