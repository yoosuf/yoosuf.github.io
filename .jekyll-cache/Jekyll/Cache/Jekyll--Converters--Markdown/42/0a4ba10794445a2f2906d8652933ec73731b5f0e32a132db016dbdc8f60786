I"¾<p>These days I am working with a News publishing App and I am involved with the Back-end API of it. Since now we are very last stage of the development we started adding the push notifications for the App, hence I had to come up with a solution when a WordPress post published then and there to trigger and event to send push notifications for the Android and iOS devices. Then while experimenting WordPress functions I came up with this solution, which is very handy and I believe it will be useful for anyone wants carry out features as such.</p>

<p>BTW, If you think there are better way to handle this, please let me know. Always improvements are great for the apps which deals with million users right?</p>
