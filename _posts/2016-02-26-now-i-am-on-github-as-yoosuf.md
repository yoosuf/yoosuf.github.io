Well, now it is 2016, I wanted to be on my name in this universe, so decided to claim name [Yoosuf](https://github.com/yoosuf) form Github yesterday, indeed which wasn't a hard process at all, Github has done the migration process so simple and yet redirects the projects to the new URL without even making me to worry about adding redirect URL's.

Recently I tried to clam the username on twitter, and seems some one who is inactive has registered the name in 2009, and who hasn't even posted a single tweet (which is absolutely no sense at all).  I really wish the social media should release such accounts for new users.
