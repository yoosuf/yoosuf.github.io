Yoosuf has worked with Ruby on Rails technology since 2009 (Ruby on Rails version 2) and having hands on experience for past five years. Yoosuf has developed and deployed a dozen of applications developed based on Rails, PG and MongoDB. Each application has been developed with TDD and BDD. Additionally each of following apps are developed adhering the incremental **agile** approach.

### The Ruby Gems

Ruby on Rails has the biggest community and daily basis pushing new gem to eliminate the repeating. following are some of the gems I often find useful and mostly use in each and every project.

* [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) Anything to do with Auth
* [Simple Form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form) To build forms
* [HAML](https://github.com/indirect/haml-rails) HTML is boring, so I use HAML
* [CarrierWave](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave) To upload anything anywhere
* [Prawn](https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn) PDF generation

## Training

I help fresher's to learn Rails, well, you can find anything online, but I give the right mentorship for people who are eager to learn the Ruby or Rails.

 Do you want a need for a MVP, a total back-end solution, an API  for mobile or review the existing project?  [Please send me a message](/contact/?utm_source=yoosuf.me&utm_medium=ror&utm_campaign=consultancy), I can give you a free quote.
