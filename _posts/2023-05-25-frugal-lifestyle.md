I've always been a bit of a frugal person, but I decided to take it to the next level in 2022. I was inspired by Dave Ramsey's book, The Total Money Makeover, and I wanted to see if I could live on a budget and still enjoy my life.

I started by creating a budget and tracking my spending. I was surprised to see how much money I was wasting on things like eating out and shopping. Once I knew where my money was going, I started to make changes.

I started cooking more meals at home and packing my lunch for work. I also started shopping at thrift stores and garage sales instead of new stores. I even started using coupons and discounts whenever possible.

It wasn't always easy, but after a few months, I started to see how little i have to spend to live a financially minimal lifestyle. I was saving more money and I was less stressed about my finances. I also had more time and energy to spend on the things that I really enjoyed.

Here are some of the things that I did to live frugally in 2022-2023:

- **Managed every penny:** Created a budget and tracked my spending. This was the first step in my journey to frugal living. It helped me to see where my money was going and where I could cut back.
- **Deleted the Uber Eats app:** Cooked more meals at home and packed my lunch for work. This saved me a lot of money on eating out. I also found that I enjoyed cooking more when I had the time to do it.
- **Unsubscribed from Netflix and PeoTV:** There are many free or low-cost activities that you can enjoy, such as going for walks, reading books from the library, or travelling via bus and more...
- **Chased everyone who owed me money:** This was the hardest one, followup everyone who owe me money (couldn't recover every penny, hence it wasn't a 100% success ). Some really got pissed with me and some stopped replying for my calls. But I felt it was worth it, because it should be done at some point.
- **Stopped Expensive hobbies:** stopped the marine aquarium, because it was a cash burn, without a return. after selling the equipment's what usd for the Marine aquarium I got back only 20% of the full spending.

Frugal living is not about depriving yourself of the things that you enjoy. It's about finding ways to enjoy your life without spending a lot of money. It's also about being mindful of your spending and making sure that you are not wasting money on things that you don't need.

If you are looking to save money and live a more fulfilling life, I encourage you to try frugal living. It may not be easy, but it is definitely worth it.

### Here are some additional tips for frugal living:

- Set financial goals. What do you want to save for? A down payment on a house? A new car? Retirement? Once you know what you are saving for, it will be easier to stay motivated.
- Find a support system. Having friends or family members who are also interested in frugal living can be helpful. You can share tips and tricks, and you can hold each other accountable.
- Don't be afraid to make changes. If you find that you are not sticking to your budget, don't be afraid to make changes. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to frugal living. - You need to find what works best for you.
- Use coupons and discounts. There are many ways to find coupons and discounts, such as online, in newspapers, and in store circulars.
- Shop at thrift stores and garage sales. This is a great way to find gently used items at a fraction of the price of new items.

Frugal living can be a great way to save money and live a more fulfilling life. If you are willing to make some changes, you can see a big difference in your finances and your overall well-being.
