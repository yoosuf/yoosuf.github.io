Why you should choose a best IDE for your project? All because, to make to coding simple and faster development and maintain standardized coding among the coders and organization. These days every IDE’s and Editors are supporting the syntax highlighting and Intellicence, additionally you should consider that your IDE/Editor is supporting source control or version controlling, because in the enterprise level development all the source code is saved in central repository, where the IDE is supporting the Frameworks integration, and testing environment. the IDE’s and Editors are categorized for 3 by the functionality;

* Light
* Intermediate
* Robust

Above categorization is mainly done by with their features and functionality and the extendability. let’s start reviewing the IDE/Editors.

## Light

Light IDEs are not much robust editors, which will help for small purposes, but can’t use them for rapid development.

## Intermediate

Intermediate level IDE’s and Editors are really useful IDE’s and editors that can be use for development, but there are some problems of extendability, so I am listing theme in this level.
