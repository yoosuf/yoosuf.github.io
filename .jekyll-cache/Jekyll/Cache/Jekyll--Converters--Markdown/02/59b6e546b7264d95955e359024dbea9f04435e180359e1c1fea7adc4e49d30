<p>Navigation / Menu handlers are the important element when it comes to the mobile apps and mobile websites. Â following is the study i went trough my latest iPhone and I came to a conclusion. here is the unÂ standardizedÂ navigation handlerÂ amongÂ the apps.</p>

<p>Most of the Websites follows the right side menu handler, including the Twitter bootsreap.</p>

<p>But when it comes to the Apps, almost every appâ€™s areÂ followingÂ the left side menu handler.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some apps are yet follows the righthand side menu handlers.</p>

<p>As a right hand phone user, I awaysÂ preferÂ the menu handler in the right side, but comparatively within the apps, there is no consistency, hence iÂ prefer the Apple should allow the users to customize the menu handlersÂ positionÂ accordingÂ to the usersÂ wish. where as the websites, it is a bit Â complication. but still web designers can make a decision based on the UX testing and user testing in the labs andÂ anonymousÂ dataÂ trackingÂ with some tools like google analytics. Specially when they are designing for theÂ targetedÂ audience, it will be moreÂ simpler.</p>
