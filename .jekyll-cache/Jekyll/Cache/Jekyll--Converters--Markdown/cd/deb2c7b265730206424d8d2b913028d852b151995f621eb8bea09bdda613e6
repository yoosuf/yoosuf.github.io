I"’<p><a href="https://github.com/eyoosuf/jqModal">jqModal</a> is one of the simple and light weighted jquery plug-in to create modal windows in your web browser without a hassle, recently when i was using jqModel with the latest version of the jQuery,Â Â I found an issue saying <code>undefined error</code> and realized jQuery library has been updated with many refractions and many feature drops for Microsoft Internet Exploreâ€™s older versions. hence I decided to change the code and republish it in my <a href="https://github.com/yoosuf">github</a> for the public use. Fork it, try it out and send pull requests, I will happily update the repository.</p>
