Yoosuf has worked with Laravel Framework since 2003 (Laravel 4X) and having hands on experience. Yoosuf has developed and deployed a dozen of applications developed using Larave and Lumen, PG and MongoDB. Each application has been developed with TDD and BDD. Additionally each of following apps are developed adhering the incremental **agile** approach.

## Training
I help fresher's to learn Laravel and Lumen, well, you can find anything online, but I give the right mentorship for people who are eager to learn the Laravel framework.

 Do you want a need for a MVP, a total back-end solution, an API  for mobile or review the existing project?  [Please send me a message](/contact/?utm_source=yoosuf.me&utm_medium=ror&utm_campaign=consultancy), I can give you a free quote.
