<a title="ExpressonEngine CMS" href="http://ellislab.com/expressionengine">ExpressionEngine</a> is one of a powerful commercial CMS system. When they introducing the version 2, they stopped the free core version and after 2 years it is yet again back with it's core features as a fermium product. as a developer I started digging in to it in my local environment and the first impression was pretty great.

ExpressionEngine 2 core is a best freemium product to start learning about the ExpressionEngine.
