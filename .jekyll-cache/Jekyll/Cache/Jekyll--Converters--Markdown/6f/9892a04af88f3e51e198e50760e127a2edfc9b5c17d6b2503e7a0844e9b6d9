I"Z<p>Recently I came across the <a href="https://github.com/RailsApps">Ruby on Rails application templates</a> (Rails Composer), if you want to quick start the application development  the Rails Composer gives wide range of options. so far I’ve used it in my local development environment,  but I will consider using it in the future.</p>
