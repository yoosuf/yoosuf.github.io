While searching for fastest php frameworks came across the <a title="Phalcon PHP Framework" href="https://twitter.com/phalconphp/following" target="_blank">Phalcon php</a>, while going trough the documentation and after seeing few examples and after following the course at <a href="https://www.udemy.com/phalconphp" target="_blank">udemy</a> came to a concision that the <a title="Phalcon PHP Framework" href="https://twitter.com/phalconphp/following" target="_blank">Phalcon php</a> is a minimal php framework that would help to write any application. Just give it a try, you will just love it.
