It's being a year or so, I am playing around with a semi professional DSLR (Nikon D7000) Camera and exploring the photography and learning new way to capture photographs each day. The photography has become actually my second passion after my work what I do. Each time when I learn and get great shots I do really enjoy and getting great positive feedback from my friends and family.

Following are some of my great shots, also a photography portfolio to come on this website very soon. Please let me know your thoughts.
