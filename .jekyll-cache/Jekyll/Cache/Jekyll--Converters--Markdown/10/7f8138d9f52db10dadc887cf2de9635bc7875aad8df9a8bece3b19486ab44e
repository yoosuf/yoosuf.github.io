I"!<p>Recenly I lost access towrds my .me domian, due to a card issue and simply godaddy perhaps has made an oppertunity with that domain to do auctioning to make more money?</p>

<p>My prevous .me domain was seven years old, which was very personal and was used to host exact same content via .me as that was the domian used by several others to host theire personal blog or a prortfilio.</p>

<p>I belive probably godaddy is trying to make out of old domains to make quick bucks, but not sure what they will going to do with my .me domain :)</p>
