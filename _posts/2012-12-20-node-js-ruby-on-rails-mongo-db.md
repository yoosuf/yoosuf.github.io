CurrentlyÂ I am working on a my MSc thesis based on visual analytics and the project is mainly based on the Node JS (to get real time data) Mondo DB (to fetch the data) and the Ruby on Rails (to create a powerful and elegant application). I will be releasing the app next year. additionally I am working with same technology to create a different kind of task management and billing application and it is called `CurLogic`.
