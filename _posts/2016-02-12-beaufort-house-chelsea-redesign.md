Recently got a chance to work with a UK based restaurant website. Which was came to me via [AVM, London](http://animalvegetablemineral.tv/?utm_source=yoosuf.me&utm_medium=beaufort_house_chelsea&utm_campaign=work) a UK based Content Development Agency based in London.

The Beaufort House Chelsea website was build on top of WordPress with amazing full sized background videos and images. Additionally to make this website possible I was using the WordPress ACF plugin to create custom fields and WP Simple 301 redirect for manage the redirection. Also using the WordPress SEO plugin by Yoast.

Additionally from the first stage of the discussion, the **performance** was word mostly talked.  Then the website design decision and development was carried on performance in mind. The new Beaufort House Chelsea website's performance was benchmark with earlier website and  found the performance was 10% increase than the previous website.

Do you want to redesign and boost the speed of the existing website? [Please send me a message](http://yoosuf.me/contact/?utm_source=yoosuf.me&utm_medium=beaufort_house_chelsea&utm_campaign=work), I can give you a free quote.

The website was looked as like this before the makeover.
