Hi, I'm Yoosuf, a full-stack developer based in London, UK, with over 14 years of experience working for small and large companies worldwide. I'm passionate about web standards, semantics, and accessibility, and I take pride in writing clean, efficient, and effective code.

As a full-stack developer, I have a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development. While front-end development allows me to bring designs to life and create unique user experiences, back-end development is essential for creating a robust and secure web application.

I have experience working with various programming languages, frameworks, and databases, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, PHP, Laravel, MySQL, and MongoDB. My expertise allows me to design and develop complex web applications from start to finish, ensuring that they are scalable, maintainable, and future-proof.

Whether it's building a simple website or a complex web application, I enjoy the challenge of delivering high-quality products that meet the needs of my clients and users. I am always eager to learn and keep up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in the industry, ensuring that my skills remain relevant and in-demand.
