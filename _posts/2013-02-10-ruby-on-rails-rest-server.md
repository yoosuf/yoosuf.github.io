If you are familiar with Ruby on Rails, you may know the Ruby allows you create REST full service without an extra effort, even thought having the REST features in application level isn't an industrial Practice, therefor I started digging in to several REST samples and finally came across <a title="Rails Cast" href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/350-rest-api-versioning" target="_blank">my favorite video cast</a>. and decided to create a sample REST server and a separate REST client.

I have added the code in the <a title="REST server by Yoosuf" href="https://github.com/eyoosuf/REST-Server" target="_blank">Github repository</a> and will be sending the fix and updates.  additionally I am working on a REST client with PHP and JavaScript (obviously jQuery). additionally you can contribute to my code.
