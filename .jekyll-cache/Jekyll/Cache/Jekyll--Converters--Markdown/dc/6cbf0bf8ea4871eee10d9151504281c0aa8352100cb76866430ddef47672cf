<h3 id="who-am-i-and-what-i-do">Who am I and what I do?</h3>

<p>Iâ€™m Yoosuf Mo,Â <del>yoosuf</del> <a href="http://twitter.com/eyoosuf">@eyoosuf</a> on twitter and elsewhere, and Iâ€™m a web developer and geek?. Iâ€™ve been doing a web development for small and big companies, alsoÂ I do web designing with black and white color scheme. now a days i am working with two personal side projects and I doÂ contractingÂ and freelancing to put food in my plate.</p>

<h3 id="whathardwaredo-i-use">WhatÂ hardwareÂ do I use?</h3>

<p>I am a Apple Fan boy, all though I was using the Windows for more than ten years and used the Â Linux (Ubuntu) for two plus year. Since 2012 Iâ€™ve beenÂ using Apple Mac for work and personal use. I am using an iPhone 4 since year 2011 and loving it.</p>

<h3 id="what-software-do-i-use">What software do I use?</h3>

<p>I am a big fan of using various softwareâ€™s, if you see my applications directory you will see a lot of softwareâ€™s. since I am a web developer I do use some of the famousÂ graphicÂ editors such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Fireworks, and Adobe Illustrator.</p>

<p>Additionally for developmentÂ proposes I do use the Sublime Text 3 and Textmate 3 and some additional IDES such as Aptana Studio 3, Eclipse and many more, but most of the time i do stick with the Sublime Text 3.</p>

<p>I am pretty muchÂ usingÂ allÂ sortsÂ of VersionÂ controlÂ systems, but IÂ preferÂ the GIT then SVN. I do Cyberduck (when i am working with traditional clients) to upload and download files. Additionally I do use the Source Tree a GUI interface for working with GIT SCM.</p>

<p>For entertainment purpose i do use the Spottify, Quick time, VLC Player, additionally I useÂ VimeoÂ and Youtube for watching entertainment videos and stuff. Once is a while I do use the iTunes for backing up and restoring my iPhone.</p>

<p>in my phone I use lots of applications, Twitter Facebook,Â InstagramÂ  Camera Plus, Camera Plus pro and so much more. Â AdditionallyÂ i do maintain my todo tasks on Things (I personally love it) than that i use Spottify on the go, personally i feel it is anÂ innovativeÂ softwareÂ app :) .</p>

<h3 id="programming">Programming</h3>

<p>I do love Ruby on Rails, but i havenâ€™t work with anyÂ clientsÂ with Ruby on Rails,Â althoughÂ I have worked with many PHP projects, Â but recentlyÂ didnâ€™tÂ get a chance to work with the latest PHP frameworks, I may need to catchup with them very soon.</p>

<h3 id="transport">Transport</h3>

<p>I am aÂ publicÂ transport user,Â pretty muchÂ usingÂ the London Underground service andÂ onceÂ in a whileÂ usingÂ the Train service. If I am bored of walking I do use the London bus service.</p>
