I"¬<p>I am Yoosuf, a Software engineer, particularly passionate about web standards, semantics and accessibility, and I enjoy writing clean, efficient and effective code. I am living in  Colombo, Sri Lanka. I have worked for number of small and large companies around the globe since year 2005.</p>

<p>Design and back-end development are essential for the web, but the exciting area where they meet is front-end development. As a front-end developer, I get to take a design â€“ something thatâ€™s beautiful but static â€“ and turn it into an interface, where its components become tools for unique experiences on the web.</p>

<p>So much is at stake in this stage! The best design can be mangled in the hands of someone uninterested or unwilling to juggle the complexities of cross-browser differences. The best deployment can cause problems down the road if someone didnâ€™t build it to be reusable and adaptable. But a great front-end developer brings designs to the fullness of their intention and sets up a webpage to be flexible and successful years into the future.</p>
