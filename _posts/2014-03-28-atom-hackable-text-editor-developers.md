![Atom - A hackable text editor for the 21st Century](http://s3.amazonaws.com/yoosuf.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/atom-editor1.jpg)



Atom is a New editor been developed by Github since the day they started the Github? I am not sure about it, but the cool part is, Atom is an editor something similar to Sublime Text, additionally it has inbuilt chrome developer tools, that's the advantage of it. other than you can experience a lighting fast than the sublime Text, and there are plenty more features...

I got six invitations for the Atom, if you want to try out the early versions of Atom, just mention me on a tweet or DM me in a tweet, would love to give your few invitations.
