Recently I lost access towards my .me domain, due to a card issue and simply godaddy perhaps has made an opportunity with that domain to do auctioning to make more money?

My previous .me domain was seven years old, which was very personal and was used to host exact same content via .me as that was the domain used by several others to host their personal blog or a portfolio.

I believe probably godaddy is trying to make out of old domains to make quick bucks, but not sure what they will going to do with my .me domain :)
