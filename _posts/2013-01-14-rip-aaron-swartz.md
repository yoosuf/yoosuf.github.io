Yesterday Aaron Swartz (worlds youngest hacker, inventor of RSS and much more) was found dead in his apartment and it is a huge loss for the Internet innovation and internet freedom. Thank you for your strive to make the Internet better place.

Good bye Aaron Swartz [Remember Aaaron Sawtz](http://www.rememberaaronsw.com)
