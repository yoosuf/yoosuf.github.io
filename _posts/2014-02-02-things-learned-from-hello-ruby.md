Lately a Kickstarter campaign is gone viral in the internet and which is <a title="Hello Ruby" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lindaliukas/hello-ruby" target="_blank">Hello Ruby</a>, by <a href="https://twitter.com/lindaliukas" target="_blank">Linda Liukas</a>. The Hello Ruby Project is one of the successful project funded in Kickstarter and more on it has reached it's funding just in a day.

The things I've learned form Hello Ruby kickstarted campaigns are;
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://twitter.com/lindaliukas" target="_blank">Linda Liukas</a> was trying to market hello ruby project before it was launched. They've been talking and presenting about teaching programming for kids.</li>
	<li>Her gorgeous look and bubbly way of talking</li>
	<li>They've been applying her personal experience and why the kids shouldn't have an easy way to learn programming.</li>
	<li>Minimal and sleek approach in the campaign and many more...</li>
</ul>
Overall it gave me an idea how to create a best campaign or marketing and execution it  in a simple and successful manner.

Congrats <a href="https://twitter.com/lindaliukas" target="_blank">Linda Liukas</a>. You've just done a great job.
