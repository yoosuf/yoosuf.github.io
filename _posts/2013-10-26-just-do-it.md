> Too often we are scared.
> Scared of what we might not be able to do.
> Scared of what people might think if we tried.
> We let our fears stand in the way of our hopes.
> We say no when we want to say yes.
> We sit quietly when we want to scream.
> And we shout at others, when we should keep our mouths shut.
> Why?
> After all, we do only go around once.
> There’s really no time to be afraid.
> So stop.
> Try something you’ve never tried. Risk it.
> Enter a triathlon.
> Write a letter to the editor. Demand a raise.
> Call winners at the toughest court. Throw away your television.
> Bicycle across the United States.
> Try bobsledding.
> Try anything!
> Speak out against the designated hitter.
> Travel to a country where you don’t speak the language.
> Patent something.
> Call her.
> You have nothing to lose and everything everything everything to gain.
> ~Barry Sanders
